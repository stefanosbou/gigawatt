A backtesting tool that mimics the OANDA API for forex strategies.

### Goal ###
Provide a backtesting tool that allows the users to
create strategies as they would need to if using the Oanda API.  The
project contains a mimic of the API classes which will interact with
the backtesting tool to hopefully represent how the Oanda servers
would behave.

### Out Of Scope ###
A client side framework that will allow a straight code move from
the backtesing tool to using the live Oanda API.

We invite developers of all experience levels to use, hack on, or join the team.
